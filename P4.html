The Oil Tank Art Center located in the west coast of Shanghai will be opened to the public on March 23rd, and teamLab has also created an immersive art exhibition for this brand-new artistic landmark. Among them, "The world of water particles in oil tanks, eliminating the boundaries of works" and "Flowers and people can coexist without control, eliminating the boundaries of works" are the core art installations of this exhibition.

Team teamLab hopes that this kind of "line aggregation" can eliminate the boundary line between viewers and works, and make viewers more immersed in works.
